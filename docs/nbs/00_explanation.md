This section of the workshop involves a series of Jupyter notebooks, with detailed comments and explanations of the code being used. You can reference these after the course: they are essentially "the answers". Please **don't** read them ahead of each session!

### During the course

At the bottom of this page, there are links to *"Launch in Colab"* for each notebook. This will open up an in-progress version of the notebook for you to save in your Google Drive. This will have large portions of the code removed, to allow you to follow along in the tutorial and learn how to build plots interactively.

### After the course

Each notebook in this section has a download arrow on the top right of the page, to allow you to save a local copy of the complete notebook. You can edit this locally or upload it to colab to work on it in the cloud.
