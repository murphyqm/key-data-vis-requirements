    Have a read through our longer introductory section [here](https://arctraining.github.io/data-vis/01-introduction.html#ten-simple-rules-for-better-figures) in your own time, as an approachable introduction to data visualisation!
    Also have a look at our [course bibliography here](https://key-data-vis-requirements-audience.streamlit.app/?utm_medium=oembed#bibliography)

This course uses Python to introduce some concepts that are core to producing good data visualisations that can both help you to better understand your results, and to communicate your research findings to a wider audience. As stated in the course blurb, this is an introductory course that focuses on static plots that may be the basis for discussion or for presentation as a figure in a report as opposed to interactive visualisations such as dashboards.

In addition to walking you through some step-by-step advice regarding libraries that are available, and building plot templates that let you save out your figures to high resolution PNGs or PDF files, we are also going to discuss how best to represent your data in a way that is meaningful, aesthetically pleasing, and scientifically robust.

Before introducing the libraries and modules that are available, or the actual step by step of how to create plots using Python, we are going to walk through some of the important considerations when deciding how you are going to visualise your data.

Choosing the type of plot to use to represent your data is not something obvious or straightforward, and is something that will never have a unique solution: there are lots of good options that may win out in certain situations.
